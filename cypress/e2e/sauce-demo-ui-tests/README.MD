## ðŸ§ª QA Skills Demonstrated

### âœ… End-to-End Workflow Coverage
- Tests simulate realistic user interactions from login to order completion.

### âœ… Assertion & Validation Logic
- Precise checks for pricing, tax, and total breakdowns
- Accurate cart item name and count validation

### âœ… Negative Testing
- Handles invalid login scenarios and ensures proper error messaging

### âœ… State Management
- Tests confirm application state (cart count, remaining items) after actions like add/remove

### âœ… Cypress Best Practices
- Uses `data-test` selectors for resilience
- `cy.log()` calls improve test traceability
- `beforeEach()` ensures isolated, repeatable tests
